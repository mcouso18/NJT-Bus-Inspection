## What is NJ TRANSIT?

NJ TRANSIT (New Jersey Transit Corporation) is a state-owned public transportation system that serves the U.S. state of New Jersey and portions of New York and Pennsylvania. It operates:
- Buses
- Light rail
- Commuter rail services

These services connect to major commercial and employment centers within New Jersey and to the adjacent major cities of New York City and Philadelphia. According to recent data, the system had a ridership of 225,620,400 in 2024.

## Was there a rail strike?

From our research, we were unable to find specific information about any recent NJ TRANSIT rail strikes. This suggests that:
1. There have not been any significant rail strikes at NJ TRANSIT recently, or
2. If there were strikes, they may not have been widely documented in the sources we could access

If you're looking for information about a specific rail strike or labor dispute involving NJ TRANSIT, or if you need more detailed information about the organization, please let me know and I can try a different approach to find that information.
