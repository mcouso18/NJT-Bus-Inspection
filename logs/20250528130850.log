Here are the typical ingredients needed for a classic chocolate cake:

**Dry Ingredients:**
- 1¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

**Wet Ingredients:**
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk (or regular milk)
- 1 cup strong black coffee (cooled) or hot water
- ½ cup vegetable oil or melted butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

**Optional for Frosting:**
- Butter
- Powdered sugar
- Cocoa powder
- Cream cheese or heavy cream
- Vanilla extract

**Basic Instructions:**
1. Mix dry ingredients in one bowl
2. Combine wet ingredients in another bowl
3. Gradually combine wet and dry ingredients
4. Bake in greased pans at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes

This recipe typically makes a two-layer 9-inch cake. The coffee enhances the chocolate flavor but doesn't make the cake taste like coffee.

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the chocolate cake recipe, such as specific measurements or baking tips?
